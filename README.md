My team developed a program that can query, analyze, and display data from the OpenFlights.org Airline dataset. Our goal was to use a NoSQL database and effective MapReduce, SQL/SPARQL/PYSPARK, and/or graph algorithms to demonstrate the use of Big Data technologies.

# How to Set Up
This project was implemented on our local machine using:
- Clone this repository 
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/product/neo4j-graph-database/)
- Setup Neo4j, create a new database, import `/Dataset csv's` into that database, import `/Schema/schema-neo4j.txt` to setup realtions for the dataset.
- Open terminal at the codebase `~.../airline-search-engine/BMW_415_Source_Code/Codebase/`
- Install dependencies 
```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run code with 
```zsh
python3 main.py 
```




# Project Overview
The "Airline Search Engine" project addresses the complexities of global air travel by utilizing data from openflights.org, which includes detailed information about airports, airlines, routes, planes, and countries. By using tools like Neo4j, PySpark, and PySimpleGUI. Our team created a search engine that provides users with functionalities such as searching for airports, airlines, and routes, finding trips with the fewest stops, and recommending cities reachable within a certain number of hops.

This search engine aims to optimize operations for travelers, airlines, and airports, enhancing travel experiences by providing quick and reliable information. Neo4jâ€™s graph database effectively models the complex relationships in the dataset, while PySpark handles large-scale data processing. This combination allows the project to scale if we had to handle more load, providing accurate and timely information to users.

We used PySimpleGUI for our user interface and it allows us to have the user log in into the graph database and then query the system. Below is some screenshots of that process.

## Project Architecture
The architecture of the "Airline Search Engine" project is centered around the openflights.org dataset and the Neo4j graph database. The dataset includes five comma-separated value (CSV) files that contain detailed information about airlines, airports, routes, planes, and countries. Neo4j's graph database model is the system we used for this project because it can efficiently model the complex relationships between these entities.

The project uses nodes to represent airports, airlines, cities, and planes, while edges represent routes, codeshares, and other relationships. This structure allows for intuitive visualization and efficient querying of the data. The architecture also incorporates PySpark for large scale data processing, enhancing the project's ability to handle and analyze big datasets. The decision to use Neo4j was driven by its capability to handle graph data effectively and its support for complex queries and visualizations.

## Files and Structure
The project repository is organized into several key files and directories. The main files include:

1. <u>airlines.csv</u> - Contains data about various airlines, including their IDs, names, IATA codes, ICAO codes, countries, and active status.
2. <u>airports.csv</u> - Includes information about airports, such as airport IDs, names, cities, countries, IATA codes, ICAO codes, latitude, longitude, altitude, timezones, and types.
3. <u>routes.csv</u> - Details the routes operated by airlines, including the airline, source airport, destination airport, codeshares, stops, and equipment used.
4. <u>planes.csv</u> - Contains data about planes, including their names and IATA codes.
5. <u>countries.csv</u> - Provides information about countries, including their names and ISO codes .

The Neo4j database schema is implemented using Cypher statements to create nodes and relationships from these CSV files. Each node (e.g., Airline, Airport, Route) and edge (e.g., OPERATES, DEPARTS_FROM, ARRIVES_AT) is defined to accurately represent the relationships within the dataset. Below is a small image of how our dataset looks in the Neo4j visualization program with our relations.

## Future Work
Future improvements could include making the search engine more like an actual search engine where users can actually enter in their own queries and the program can have related answers.
